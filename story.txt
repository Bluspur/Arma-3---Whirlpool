Horizon Island 2039. 

BACKGROUND
The significant Malaria outbreak of 2038 is over, the people have been cured of the disease. 
The horizon islands are still politcally dominated by the pro CSAT Nouveaux Horizons party.
The distribution of a vaccine was carried out by IDAP (through samples developed in the US based on CSAT research).
With the "cure" came rumours of CSAT involvement in the creation of the virus.
Le Ensemble, have been more and more active in the jungles of Tanoa, pushing government forces harder than ever.
CSAT, no longer having the pretense of disease control, withdraw a significant amount of their forces off the island.
They instead come to rely upon embedded local advisors with the growing Horizon Islands Defence Force (HIDF).

SITUATION
NATO has dispatched a small naval task force to the area around the Horizon Islands in order to oversee any developments in the situation.
Confindentially, CTRG elements are being deployed onto the islands to perform recon, make contact with and support Le Ensemble.
Your Area of Operations consists of the south east island of Iles de Lijn.
HIDF presence on Iles de Lijn is centered primary around the towns of Lijnhaven and Harcourt.
Together they guard the Main Supply route that runs from the mainland to Lijnhaven harbour.
Smaller HIDF hardpoints exist around the island that either perform a particular function, or act as a staging point for patrols.
There is known to be a single highly dangerous SR-750 AA system (provided by CSAT), which significantly threatens any friendly air assets.
Le Ensemble is known to operate in and control significant portions of the jungle interior and frequently raid government positions.
